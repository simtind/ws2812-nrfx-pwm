  Worldsemi WS2812 LED strip, nRFX PWM binding

  Driver bindings for controlling a WS2812 or compatible LED
  strip with a PWM output.

  Use of this driver implies an 16x internal memory overhead (2 bytes of
  driver RAM overhead per bit of pixel data).

compatible: "worldsemi,ws2812-pwm"

include: 
  - ws2812.yaml
  - pinctrl-device.yaml
